> Everytime I look into your lovely eyes
> I see a love that money just can't buy.

> One look from you I drift away
> I pray that you are here to stay.

> CHORUS:
> Anything you want you got it
> Anything you need you got it

> Everytime I hold you I begin to understand
> Everything about you tells me I'm your man.

> I live my life to be with you
> No one can do the things you do.

> CHORUS (2x)

> I'm glad to give my love to you
> I know you feel the way I do.

> CHORUS
