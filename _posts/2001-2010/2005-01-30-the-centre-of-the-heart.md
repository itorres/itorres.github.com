What am I gonna do when I get a little excited,
a little in pain, tell me
What am I gonna say when I find the centre of my heart
is a suburb to the brain!!!

You wear them so well, those innocent eyes
You're putting on a wonderful disguise
I want you so bad. I'm pushing my luck
It feels like being hit by a truck
This is no place special. Don't know why I came
If someone has a minute, won't you explain

What am I gonna do when I get a little excited,
a little in pain, tell me
What am I gonna say when I find the centre of my heart
is a suburb to the brain singing na na na na na na!

Being with you, dealing with fire
Oh won't you come around (come out) come out (today) and play
I want you so bad
Answer my calls
Let's spend the night within these walls

This is no place special
Nothing for the sane
If someone's got minute, do please explain
