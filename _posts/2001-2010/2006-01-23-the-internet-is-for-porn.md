Ok, it seems the [incredible  World of Warcraft video][1] lacks an original song. As [this 2004 article][2] states it is part of a Broadway show called [Avenue Q][3].
Now I want to see the show. It reminds me of _Disregard this play_ by _The Neo-Futurists_ and the computer animated version by _Chris Landreth_.
