There has been much ado about Google's and Verizon new policy recommendation and we have a problem: there are reasons to be afraid, angry and to declare war.

The Ars Technica article [A paper trail of betrayal: Google's net neutrality collapse][ars] compares the last Google & Verizon recommendations with three Google filings with the FCC in the past three years about net neutrality.

The Huffington Post has written extensively about it in several articles:

* [Google Goes "Evil"][hevil]
* [Google-Verizon Pact: It Gets Worse][hworse]
* [Google-Verizon Deal: The End of The Internet as We Know It][hdeal]

I cannot sum anything to what better communicators than me have already written. But the thing I can do is boycott the traitor and I'm doing it already, dropping my use of all things Google. The harder will be, of course the search engine.

If you want a free (as in freedom) alternative to Gmail and Google Apps for your domain I can recommend the services of [SDF][]. I have used them for a long time and I'm creating a community based on their philosophy in [sdf.cat][].

It was fun and easy while it lasted. It will be funnier but harder now. We will probably lose a lot of quality in our network connections, but not our freedom.

We shall prevail.
