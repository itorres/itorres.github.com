Today I received my [Openmoko Freerunner][freerunner]. Every action should have a reason, and I will explain mine in a future entry titled 0 Day. Now let's see how my acquisition went.

I decided to buy my Freerunner on [Tuxbrain][tuxbrain] due to several reasons:

* [Sustainability][sustainability]

  Tuxbrain is located in the neighbour shire, at a mere 55km by road.


* Updated hardware

  Tuxbrain sells the Freerunner with the GSM firmware upgraded to [moko11][moko11] and the hardware updated to avoid the [buzz bug][buzzbug].

* Development funding

  Every item bought at Tuxbrain has a [COfundOS][cofundos] amount associated. This means that with the purchase of my Freerunner Tuxbrain contributes 5â‚¬ for the development of new ideas.

* Fast shipping

  Tuxbrain states that you will receive the goods 24h after shipping.

And how was the experience? Great. I placed my order on Monday at 00:29. The same day, at 14:17 I received an email stating that they were out of stock and that shipment would be realized on Wednesday.

Tuesday, at 17:33 I received an email saying that my Freerunner had shipped. And I received it today around 10:00.

So they put their actions where their mouth is. And they informed me of the order state in every moment. My best online shopping experience to date.
