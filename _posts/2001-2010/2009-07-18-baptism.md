New machines means new names. For the last ten years I have used planetary missions names, hence:

* Server: deepspace
* Server: skylab
* Laptop: cassini
* Laptop: mariner
* Phone: voyager
* Phone: huygens (associated to cassini)

With the arrival of an Android phone this changes. Guess the theme:

* Phone: marvin
* Server: slartibartfast
* Laptop: zaphod
