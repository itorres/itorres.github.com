Completely unsorted:

* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/itorres): Interesting. In [Kottke's](http://www.kottke.org/07/03/twitter) words, it reminds me of blogging circa 2000.
* [Nokia N95](http://europe.nokia.com/phones/n95): Last toy. Sorry Apple, but though I shouldn't trust the rumor mill, the iPhone seems to take ages to come to Spain. Maybe in late 2008 I'll consider getting one with a hack-free SDK. And I promised myself not to buy any more 1.0 Apple products (suffered OS X 10.0, the Powerbook 12", the CoreDuo Macbook...)
* DIY(Do it yourself): I'm learning every kind of tricks about getting an XVIII century house last refurbished in 1960 ready to 2007 standards. 2010 exceeds our budget.
* Acting as a guy near his thirties, rather than a boy in his early twenties.
