> Every time I think of you
> I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue
> It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find
> Living a life that I can't leave behind
> There's no sense in telling me
> The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
> But that's the way that it goes
> And it's what nobody knows
> And every day my confusion grows

> Every time I see you falling
> I get down on my knees and pray
> I'm waiting for that final moment
> You'll say the words that I can't say.

> I feel fine and I feel good
> I feel like I never should
> Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
> Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
> I'm not sure what this could mean
> I don't think you're what you seem
> I do admit to myself
> That if I hurt someone else
> Then we'd never see just what we're meant to be

> Every time I see you falling
> I get down on my knees and pray
> I'm waiting for that final moment
> You'll say the words that I can't say.
