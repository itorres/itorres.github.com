I have been a happy Mac user for a few years. Anyone should admit that using a Mac is one of the best user experiences available. But as we say in Spain, the better is the enemy of the good. Or something like that.

The thing is that lately I have noticed that an itch has developed in a serious grievance. I want to control what my computer does, and using a Mac is like driving with automatic gear. I feel like living in an enormeous and luxurious palace with no exit doors. I have everything I need, but I cannot do otherwise.

For example, I have been a subscriber of .Mac for nearly a year now and I still can't control what gets synchronized and how. When there is a conflict between my laptop and the main computer iSync states so, but sometimes I'm not allowed to choose what version I want to maintain. This is a nuisance with bookmarks or iCal appointments, but when it reachs the limits of my keychain passwords it's not that funny. And now that we speak about keychain sync... how is it done? Is it secure or not? Too many interrogants.

So I'm in the process of "unMacintoshing" myself. I'm starting by switching two applications for everyday use: Firefox for Safari and Thunderbird for Mail.app. With them I also leave behind the address book.

I can sync the mozilla suite straightforward via rsync. I could even work it out a bit and sync through a svn repository. Let's see where this leads to.
