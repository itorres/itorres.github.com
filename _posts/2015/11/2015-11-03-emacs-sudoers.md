title: "2015 wk.45: Emacs talk at sudoers bcn - Coders at Work"

Today I did a presentation in the [November suders meetup][sudoers201511] explaining why I switched to Emacs [earlier this year][]. I used [an orgfile][] as a base and walked through it, doing demonstrations of different Emacs functionalities as org-mode, tramp, shells, magit, projectile and use-package.

[sudoers201511]: http://lanyrd.com/2015/sudoersbcn/
[earlier this year]: /2015/03/04/emacs/
[Coders at work]: http://codersatwork.com/
[an orgfile]: /s/2015/11/sudoers.org

I forgot to mention some functionalities I continually use: [org-mode as a daily planner][], [helm-dash][] to consult context API [documentation from Dash][] and [wordnut][] to consult the [wordnet][] lexical database for English or [flycheck][] to do syntax checking of different languages.

Also, a great way to do a fast start in Emacs is to use [Prelude][], an already configured and somewhat opinionated Emacs distribution.

People shown interest in my reference to the [Coders at Work][] book by [Peter Seibel][] so I'm linking to its website. The book consists of great interviews to 15 of the best programmers of all time, namely:
