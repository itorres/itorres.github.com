I tried emacs for the first time 20 years ago. Since then I've tried to use it several times to no avail until 15 days ago something clicked.

After 15 days I feel more productive with it than I felt with vim for the best part of my life. In fact for some tasks I am more productive with emacs than with vim some weeks ago.

Some features that made me say "wow":

* Tramp mode
* ediff mode
* Version control

But the real thing is how the same shortcuts though doing different commands in different modes always seem to do *the sensible thing*.

And to top it all, Lisp. It has grown on me as I tuned my `~/.emacs` to the extent that I started reading Siebel's ["Practical Common Lisp"][].
