Since a few weeks ago I stopped serving the website from AWS and started serving it from home.

For that it is quite handy being a member of a [free (as in freedom) network][guifibages] that supplies his associates with a static IPv4 address and a /48 IPv6 prefix.

Right now it's being served from a [SmartOS][] zone but I am already thinking of migrating the new server to [FreeBSD][].

This is only a small step of my _declouding_ process. For some things the SaaS proposal is quite handy but I want my personal data under strict control not only for privacy but also for data integrity issues.

In fact I am in a quite radical standpoint and since summer I use [FOSS][] exclusively for my personal tasks. I still use some SaaS for work.
