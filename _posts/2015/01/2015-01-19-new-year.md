  * I've been using [acme(1)][] through [plan9port][] for a few weeks and I'm enjoying it.
  * I worked for a couple of months in november and december as a backend python developer in an [interesting project][passnfly] with [interesting people][adnam].
  * I am back to my origins and joined [Stradivarius][] as a Frontend Developer last Monday.
  * You should be reading this through https.
  * After using Ubuntu 14.04LTS on the Macbook Air for a couple of months I am back to OS X 10.9. Having native [Docker][] was great, but I lost a lot of other functionality. Like effing headphones and hibernation.
  * I am settling on Ansible as a [bootstrapping][] technology. I [don't really believe][immutableservers] in the configuration management panacea anymore.
