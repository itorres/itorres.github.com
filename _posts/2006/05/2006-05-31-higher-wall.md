> We're out here on the borders with our favourite few possessions  
> Traded stories whispered round the fire  
> As shadows in the searchlights, mugshots in the files  
> Waiting in the camps behind the wire  
> Kick the door until it opens, what you have you cannot hold  
> We are young, forever hungry, you are fat and growing old  
> Still every day you try to build a higher wall

> We pick the leaves of coca, we stack the crates of cola  
> We wait upon the tables where you dine  
> And learn from you not to accept the little that we're given  
> To take the piece of silver where we can  
> Now clutching at these papers in another office line  
> We're staring from the darkness up at windows filled with light  
> And every day you try to build a higher wall

> In my town we used to pray to idols sent from far away  
> From out beyond the dusty days, we heard your voices call  
> And in your town the streets are cleaned  
> The order stands, the sirens scream  
> You talk of peace, vacation dreams - and reinforce the wall

> Now in the queues at immigration, in the border zone  
> We are your bastard children, all coming home  
> And every day you try to build a higher wall  
> Every day you try to build a higher wall  
> But your money cannot stop us  
> And you violence cannot stop us  
> No you will never stop us with your higher wall
