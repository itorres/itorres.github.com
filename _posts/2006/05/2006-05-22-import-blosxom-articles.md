My first attempt hacking typo.

I found [Justus Pendleton's code][1] to import blosxom entries into typo, but it is old, august 2005. Now the things are quite different, so I did the usual spaghetti massacre.

Check the source and run with -h for help. It has to be executed from $typo/db/converters.
