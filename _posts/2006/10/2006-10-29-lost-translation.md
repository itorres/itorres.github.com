I like to write in different languages for different things. I'd like Tagalog to support, and promote, multilanguage sites. And it is quite easy: name the post file (did I tell you that Tagalog, like Blosxom, is based on plain text files?) with its iso code like this one:

    lost_in_translation.en.markdown

Easy and simple. [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).
