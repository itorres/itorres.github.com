## Desktop
I've been using a Thinkpad with Ubuntu since last summer. It's great.

## Cloud
I'm using [ampache][], [wallabag][] and [ttrss][] in my homeserver to handle my media needs and scrobbling to my [libre.fm][] profile.

## Mobile
The mobile needs are handled by a [Sailfish OS][] powered [Jolla][] smartphone. I still need to get used to its UX. Some things are really neat (I surprise myself trying to slide on my Android phone) but some others are completely contraintuitive.

## Pending
I want to like [camlistore][] but it simply is too cumbersome to use so I will probably end using [syncthing][] for file synchronization.
