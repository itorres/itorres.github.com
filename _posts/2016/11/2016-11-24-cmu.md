Tuesday night while reading the original [Nix paper][] I thought the
typesetting was beautiful and how nice my Emacs experience would be
with the monospaced font of the code listings.

[Nix paper]: http://nixos.org/~eelco/pubs/nspfssd-lisa2004-final.pdf

And then I realized those papers were surely typesetted with LaTeX and
remembered that Knuth made original typefaces for TeX. A quick search
and... Hello [Computer Modern][]. Aren't you gorgeous?

As in this side of the Atlantic we have the finicky custom of writing
with non-ascii characters I looked for a unicode variant of the fonts
and found it in the [cm-unicode][] project. There's even someone who
already did the job of preparing it as [web fonts][].

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Look at my code, my code is amazing. Give it a lick.")
}
```
