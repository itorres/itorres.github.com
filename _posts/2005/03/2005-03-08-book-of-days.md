> One day, one night, one moment,  
> My dreams could be, tomorrow.  
> One step, one fall, one falter,  
> East or west, over earth or by ocean.  
> One way to be my journey,  
> This way could be my book of days.

> Ó lá go lá, mo thuras,  
> An bealach fada romham.  
> Ó oíche go hoíche, mo thuras,  
> Na scéalta nach mbeidh a choích.

> No day, no night, no moment,  
> Can hold me back from trying.  
> I'll flag, I'll fall, I'll falter,  
> I'll find my day may be,  
> Far and away,  
> Far and away.

> One day, one night, one moment,  
> With a dream to believe in.  
> One step, one fall, one falter,  
> And a new earth across a wide ocean.  
> This way became my journey,  
> This day ends together,   
> Far and away.  

> This day ends together,   
> Far and away.  
> Far and away.
