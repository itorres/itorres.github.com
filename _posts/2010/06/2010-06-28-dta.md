DTA: Don't trust anyone. Not even yourself.

Closely related to [Freedom 0][]. I am making periodic backups of my data in
Google Services thanks to the great work made by
[the Data Liberation Front][dlf].

Did you backup your digital life today? It's a €100 (2 x €50 hard drives, onsite
and offsite respectively. Enough for pictures and misc data) yearly investment
that pays off in the long run.

If you have tons of video. Well. Good luck on finding a sane option.
