You probably have read something about spanish super-judge Baltasar Garz贸n. A hero for the victims of dictatorships, he tried to extradite Augusto Pinochet in 1998 to put him on trial for several crimes against humanity, among them genocide, conspiracy to murder, kidnapping, hostage taking and torture.

Last year it was famous that it was him the one put on trial over accusations of abusing power in a case related with bribery and corruption in the spanish government. Meanwhile he was also conducting an investigation about the victims of the [francoist dictatorship][] investigating, you guessed it, several crimes against humanity, among them genocide, conspiracy to murder, kidnapping, hostage taking and torture.

You can read all about  in the judge's profiles in [The New York Times][], [The Guardian][] and [Wikipedia][].


What you won't find is the fact that Garz贸n, in 1992, didn't investigate the allegations of tortures made by a group of young catalan independentists. You won't find it in Wikipedia. You won't find it in mass media profiles. You won't find it in the [Spanish Justice Ministry website][] where they list the cases against Spain.

This constitutes a violation of Article 3 of the [Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms][] as was [ruled by the [European Court of Human Rights][] in 2004.

So next time you hear about Garz贸n, keep this in mind. The super judge *is not* against tortures, and coaction of human rights  when he is the one taking profit of them.
