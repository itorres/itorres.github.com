For two weeks I've been using an "old" [Nokia Lumia 800][lumia800] I had
forgotten about.

I got the Lumia in January 2012, tried it and put it in a drawer with a "meh"
sensation. A couple of weeks ago I got fed up with the slugginesh of my iPhone 4
and started looking for an alternative.

Android did not cut it for it's performance on my Nexus 7 is far from being
brilliant. A friend of mine lent me a [Geeksphone Peak][peak] and I don't have
words to describe how horrible the [Firefox OS][] experience is.

I remembered the old Lumia and got it out of spite. The first surprise was being
unable to use it for the best part of an afternoon while it updated itself to
Windows Phone 7.8. Then I was able to start to configure it.

First step, create a Windows Live account linked to my torresmasdeu.name email
account. Configuring my work (Exchange) and personal (Google Apps), Facebook and
LinkedIn accounts was a breeze. I had easy and fast access to all my email,
calendars and contacts. The ability to merge accounts is great and reminds me a
lot of Palm's WebOS Synergy. The great point is that my phone's People Hub
becomes a single point of communication and it has a web version on
people.live.com.

Then I looked for an alternative to [Google Authenticator][gauth] and found
that [Microsoft has an inhouse one][authenticator].

And the final shoe falled today as I discovered in a [ZDNet article][zdnet]
about [Windows Live Domains][domains]. I thought "what the hell" and changed my
MX to point to Microsoft's platform.

It bugs me that I'm changing a propietary platform for another one, but this one
is more open to foreign ecosystems. In fact it's obvious that the Windows hubs
are not only a trendy gimmick but a concept. One account to rule them all.

I would greatly prefer to use an open alternative but let's be frank. Managing
the set of services needed for this kind of integration is a lot of work and I
know about no utility or set of utilities that seamlessly integrates so many
functions in a so easy to setup manner.
