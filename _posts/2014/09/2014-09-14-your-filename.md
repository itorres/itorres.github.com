## First days with an Asus T100

My mother in law has this frankenlaptop. The keyboard is flaky, the included Windows 8.1 is awful and the position of buttons and ports is erratic to say the least. I will reinstall it with Ubuntu 14.10 in the following weeks. 

The out of fabric experience can be summed up by [Bertie's description of Aunt Agatha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunt_Agatha#Aunt_Agatha_as_described_by_Bertie).

## On Dropbox, Google Drive and Onedrive pricing
$9.99 per 1TB is lower than Glacier's price without its usage limitations. Time to check those SLAs. And APIs.

## Life in a browser
I am writing this in the aforementioned T100.

- With LastPass, 2 factor authentication and OAuth tokens I feel secure.
- 50% of my activities can be done in a browser.
- The other 50% is majorly expent in a terminal.
- Virtual servers are dirt cheap (Don't you have one? Here you are, [$10 credit for Digital Ocean](http://emailcampaigns.cmail1.com/t/i-l-eatyk-qgnluk-j/)). Ultra low latency desktop development servers are even cheaper.
