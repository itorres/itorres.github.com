Steven Levy at his best: [How the NSA Almost Killed the Internet][1]. A great summary of every leak (to date) and its political and economic significance.

You know Tim Bray, don't you? His take on [development languages in 2014][2]. TL;DR: We're screwed in the client side.

Another googler, Brett Slatkin, advocates to have a [dialectic instead of a debate][3] when techs and product managers discuss anything. It's common sense, but it's also quite easy to end in the wrong side of it without noticing.

A great (and maybe a bit controversial) [interview to Gregorio Mor√°n][4]. It has some great historical quotes and, even if you don't trust it, it can give you starting points to lead your study of recent spanish history.
