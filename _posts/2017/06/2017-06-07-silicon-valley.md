If everything goes according to plan I will be in Silicon Valley from
June 14th to June 26th.

I will _definitely_ visit:

- The [DNA Lounge][]. (Probably on [June 16][]): The club [jwz][] created after leaving Netscape
  and Mozilla.
- The [Ames Research Center][ames]

Other ideas will be well received.
