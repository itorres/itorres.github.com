  > The Bullet Journal is a customizable and forgiving organization
  > system. It can be your to-do list, sketchbook, notebook, and
  > diary, but most likely, it will be all of the above. It will teach

    >  Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page
    >  that tells you something about the background of this person or
    >  business. For short, people just call it an “about page”.

  > **NS:** I guess I'd turn it around and say that if you're a
  > science-fiction writer, that's the only tool you’ve got. It may

  > that there is a practical value in a more optimist kind of science
  > fiction, and that's sort of the basis for the [Hieroglyph anthology][]
  > we published last year. The argument there is that a lot of times
  > people who want to build a new thing can sort of rally around
  > visionary science fiction and say, "This expresses the vision of
  > what we're trying to build."
