Thirteen years ago I moved to Catalonia.

Since then and in no particular order I: met Sara, became a parent of
three kids, ran over a series of jobs and professional projects, moved
two times inside Barcelona and a last one to Sallent, learnt Catalan,
improved my English a lot, started telecommuting, founded
[guifibages][], a non profit internet provider over [Guifi][], and
started cooperating with local far-left collectives. Among many
other things.

Not bad for thirteen years. Let's see what the years until 2030 yield.
