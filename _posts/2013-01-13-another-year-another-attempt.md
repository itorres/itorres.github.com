This time I'll follow the steps I found in a blog post aptly named [Static blogging the Jekyll way][jekyllway]. [Jekyll][]  has several features I dig:

* It's a static site generator.
* It's backed on plain text files and I can choose to write textile, markdown, you name it.
* Hence, I can use vim to edit my posts and keep them in git.
* The [YAML Front Matter][] is neat.

I'm in the process of importing my old entries conveniently curated. This means that many articles which don't reflect my current thoughts will not be published, though they will be available on the git repository.
