This time I'll follow the steps I found in a blog post aptly named [Static blogging the Jekyll way][jekyllway]. [Jekyll][]  has several features I dig:

* It's a static site generator.
* It's backed on plain text files and I can choose to write textile, markdown, you name it.
* Hence, I can use vim to edit my posts and keep them in git.
* The [YAML Front Matter][] is neat.
