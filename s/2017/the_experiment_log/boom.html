<p>This section looks at the various experiments that several college 
students (myself included) tried out of simple curiosity and, more often, 
sheer boredom. I hope that you find this stuff funny...
but I also hope that you don't do it yourself. I have the feeling that
we were just lucky that we didn't royally toast ourselves, or burn down our 
poor 
dorm room that we repeatedly bar-b-qued on a nightly basis, but then 
that's just my opinion. You'd be amazed what you can do with duct tape and
a gallon of common, household bleach.</p>

#1: Propane Balloons</font><img src="tny_et.gif" hspace="5" height="37" width="50"></p></center>

<p>This little adventure wasn't what we might call a resounding success,
but it was entertaining in its own way.</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Situation<br>
<br>
</font></u>Being college freshman without cars, my roommate and I often
found ourselves stuck at the dorms in the evenings on weekends. Having
slaved away over books and having pumped out homework all week, we were
(quite understandably) irritated that we were forced to spend our free
time stranded on campus. Where was our entertainment? Television reception
was close to squat on our side of the dorm (the school had claimed, when
WE entered the dorms in 1995, that cable TV would be available in all of
the dorm rooms. When they <i>finally</i> did put in cable in late 
<i>1997</i>, we had already ran away screaming from the college's 
on-campus housing to a cozy apartment.)
Those that are denied entertainment are forced to create their own...</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Equipment Involved</font></u></p>

<p>A propane torch (one of those simple $15 jobs that you buy at K-Mart),
a package of balloons, a fishing rod (briefly &quot;borrowed&quot; from
one of my roommates), and imagination.</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Plan of Action</font></u></p>

<p>By placing a balloon on the end of the propane torch's nozzle, we simply
turn on the gas flow and <i>viola, </i>balloons filled with propane. It
was our guess that a propane-filled balloon would make a pretty spectacular
show if we somehow managed to get it into an open flame and get away fast
enough to appreciate the show without getting sizzled. After pondering
the best way to accomplish this feat, we devised our plan of action:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attach the balloon to the fishing pole</li>

<li>Dangle the balloon-on-a-line down to the ground from the second floor
of the dorm</li>

<li>Swing the balloon around until it hit a small fire conviently started
on the ground outside the dorm for the experiment</li>

<li>Enjoy the resulting show, then run like hell before we got caught</li>
</ul>

<p><u><font size="+2">What <i>Actually </i>Happened</font></u></p>

<p>This is where that &quot;not quite a resounding success&quot; bit comes
in. We made the mistake of simply placing the actual propane torch on the
ground, instead of making a small, open fire. After lowering the balloon
from the second floor balcony of the dorm down to the propane torch, I
waved the fishing rod around until the balloon swung into the torch's flame.
A quick &quot;POP&quot; noise was followed by the propane torch's flame
being blown out by the sudden WHOOSH of escaping propane from the balloon.</p>

<p>Not to be discouraged by this, we pulled out our second balloon (which,
by the way, was MUCH bigger than the first.) At this point, I was grabbed
by an ROTC cadet and hauled off to do some inane ROTC thing (I think it
was making a banner out of a bed sheet...) This left my roommate alone
holding a fishing pole and a balloon filled with propane. This all occured
about ten seconds before 3 RAs (resident advisors... commonly known to
us as the &quot;Fun Police&quot;...) showed up on the scene.</p>

<p>I happened to miss the resulting show between my roommate and the RAs,
but it was all captured for posterity on video tape.</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">Lessons Learned</font></u></p>

<ul>
<li>Lookout for any wandering authority figures - ten seconds of warning
is usually enough to escape if you plan ahead</li>

<li>Always have a backup propane torch for those occasions when your main
torch gets confiscated by RAs</li>

<li>Serious experimenters would have actually started a real fire out there
on the ground</li>

<li>It is probably better not to draw the attention of the whole dorm to
your little escapades</li>
</ul>

<p>This was, in hindsight, pretty stupid... but it was the college's microwave,
not ours, so why not?</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Situation</font></u></p>

<p>At 2:00 AM, the typical college dorm has just quieted down because everyone
has realized that they have only six hours to complete that term paper
they haven't started that is due for their 8:00 AM class. This quiet time
is when the adventurous dorm experimenters (who had the common sense to
do their homework several hours earlier), have their free time. Since the
idea of doing homework BEFORE screwing around throws these experimenters
into a different time zone than the rest of the dorm, they are <i>again
</i>forced to entertain themselves (instead of taking part in a relatively
safe activity... like <i>watching cable TV</i>.)</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Equipment Involved</font></u></p>

<p>The standard microwave found in every suite of our dorm and several
items (both edible and non-edible) that were randomly designated as test
subjects.</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Plan of Action</font></u></p>

<p>I think that just about every kid, when reaching that magic age of 5
or 6, suddenly begins to take an interest in that magic thing known as
a microwave. As much as everyone seems to deny it, the microwave still
holds some fascination for folks of all ages. In our particular case, the
microwave was designated a source of experimentation because:</p>

<ul>
<li>There was all sorts of junk roaming around our dorm room that was small
enough to cram into the microwave</li>

<li>The microwave belonged to the college, not us, meaning we could abuse
it horribly and not feel a single pang of guilt</li>

<li>What ELSE is there to do at 2:00 AM in the morning on a school night?
Sleep?</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, our plan of action was set. We were going to nuke into oblivion
anything we thought we could fit in the microwave.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a lot more juice in the typical microwave than you think</li>

<li>While microwaving metal is pretty entertaining, its cheaper to buy
fireworks than a new microwave</li>

<p>You might want to hold back on doing this one if you want your security
deposit back when you move.</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Situation</font></u></p>

<p>Having a candle in a dorm room is just asking for trouble. It takes
about ten seconds for a candle to make the transition from decoration to
toy... especially when it's around people who don't have access to alternate,
safer entertainment sources (say, <i>cable TV.</i>)</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Equipment Involved</font></u></p>

<p>One large candle (about 2 inches in diameter and 8 inches tall), one
can of soda, one coathanger, and the always-necessary propane torch.</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Plan of Action</font></u></p>

<p>Anyone that has ever heard about a grain silo blowing up when a spark
of static electricity touched off the dust in the silo will appreciate
this one. Our plan of action was fairly direct:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gently scrape some wax off of the candle while drinking the can of
soda</li>

<li>Cut the now-empty soda can in half</li>

<li>Bend the coathanger into a holder that can suspend the soda can in
the air</li>

<li>Dump the wax in the suspended soda can</li>

<li>Heat the wax from underneath with the propane torch until it melts
and then, eventually, catches on fire</li>

<p><i>...and last but not least...</i></p>

<li>Dump water into the now flaming wax</li>
</ul>

<p>The water jumps to a boil almost instantly. The suddenly-boiling water
launches all of the flaming wax up into the air, increasing the burning
glob's surface area and <i>WHOOSH</i>, Hiroshima revisited.</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">What <i>Actually </i>Happened</font></u></p>

<p>After scraping a decent amount of wax off of the candle, we hacked the
can in half and went to work creating a make-shift holder for the can from
the coat hanger. I don't relish the idea of holding a can whose temperatures
are approaching that of the sun, so our newly created can-holder was put
into action.</p>

<p>We began dumping flakes of wax into our little can-shaped miracle maker.
After filling half of the can with wax chunks, we brought the propane torch
into play by cranking the baby up and bar-b-queing the bottom of the can.
The wax chips started to melt into a little liquidy glop of stuff. The
glop then proceeded to turn into a watery puddle of stuff. We watched with
eager anticipation.</p>

<p>It is probably important to mention that, at that moment in the experiment,
I still had hair on my body.</p>

<p>Once our soda can o' wax reached the point where it was hot enough to
catch on fire, we brought the propane torch out from underneath the can
and pointed the torch's flame directly into the wax. A few quick licks
of flame over the surface of the wax became a steady glow. We now had a
can, filled with molten wax, that was ON FIRE.</p>

<p>At this time, we shut off the lights in our room to add to the event.
I gingerly reached over the top of the flaming wax with a shot glass filled
with water. After a moment of hesitation, I dumped the water into the soda
can.</p>

<p>I'm fairly certain that all of the energy that 
disappears into a
black hole popped into our room for a brief visit. A flaming mushroom cloud
that was a good <i>five feet</i> in diameter lauched upward from the can,
sailing into the ceiling. However, the power we had just unleashed wasn't
yet satisfied. The ball of flame did <i>not</i> disperse when it hit the
ceiling, like we had originally planned, but instead rolled across the
ceiling like a scene from Backdraft. Good thing the ceilings in our dorm
are made of concrete. After crusing across the ceiling, the flaming mass
finally gave up when it hit the far wall of the room. This whole process
took roughly one second.</p>
<center><img src="nwhyd.gif"></center>
<p>It is probably important to mention that, at that moment in the experiment,
I no longer had hair on my body.</p>

<p>We were, quite obviously, very proud of the mighty display of open flame
we had just pioneered. We were not, however, very happy about the somewhat
obvious blast mark that now existed in the middle of the ceiling. We set
to work scrubbing the ceiling, but our moods were not heightened by the
six inches of smoke that crept along the ceiling, or the fact that the
temperature in the room had just jumped a good 15 degrees.</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">Lessons Learned</font></u></p>

<ul>
<li>This is quite possibly the most bang-for-the-buck you are ever going
to see</li>

<li>Make someone <i>else</i> dump the water into the flaming, scalding
wax</li>

<li>Assign a clean-up crew before you have God visit you personally...
enthusiasm dies down after the main event</li>

<li>Don't leave anything in a plastic bag on a high shelf in the room you
do this in... unless you want it shrink-wrapped</li>
</ul>

#4: PVC Artillery</font><img src="tny_et.gif" hspace="5" height="37" width="50"></p></center>

<p>Maybe the Army should check into this one, seeing as how they
always have so many peeled potatoes lying around...</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Situation<br>
<br>
</font></u>After one of our intrepid experimentors came back after a 
weekend visit back home, he told us about his adventures with a small 
cannon, made completely of PVC, that he had the chance to play with 
during his visit. We all listened to his stories with keen interest, and 
we began to get that gleam in our eyes that makes insurance companies 
shudder.</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Equipment Involved</font></u></p>

<p>Somewhere around $20 in PVC parts (pipes, caps, reducers), duct tape, 
a couple of bolts and a bar-b-que grill ignition sparker.</p>

<p><u><font size="+2">The Plan of Action</font></u></p>

<p>The PVC cannon is a bit of pyrotechnical folklore that has been passed 
down for many years. Many folks have heard about fashioning heavy-duty 
artillery from common, household plumbing, but we decided to give it a 
whirl because, quite frankly, we thought it would be fun to launch 
vegetables into the next county.  After drawing up a plan for the cannon, 
we went to work on the straight-forward construction of it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cut the PVC piping to the correct lengths to create a blast chamber 
and barrel</li>

<li>Attach and glue the components of the cannon together</li>

<li>Wire the grill sparker to the two ignition bolts, then place the ends 
of the bolts inside of the blast chamber a small distance apart</li>

<li>Fill the blast chamber with hair spray, ram-rod a potato down the 
barrel, and click the sparker</li>
</ul>

<p>The hair spray is ignited by the spark arcing from one bolt to the 
other, and the resulting explosion sends the potato up and out of the 
cannon's barrel, flying into lunar orbit without any help from NASA.</p>
<p><u><font size="+2">What <i>Actually </i>Happened</font></u></p>

<p>The PVC cannon's construction was fairly straight-forward, since we 
all had a pretty good idea of what we were doing. All of us had played 
with PVC artillery back home, and we all had different ideas as to how 
the cannon should be constructed.  The net result of our planning was a 
cannon that was powerful enough to punch through a street sign with a 
pipe fitting, but light enough to carry at high speed if the need for a 
quick exit arose.</p>

<p>After the glue had dried, the cannon was ready to be tested. Our first 
test involved filling the blast chamber with hairspray, then firing it 
without anything loaded.  The rather interesting result of this test was 
a large plume of flame spewing out of the end of the cannon's barrel, 
accompanied by a noise that sounded like the yelp a puppy makes when it 
has just been accidentally stepped on. The noise echoed off into the 
night, probably waking up most of our apartment complex.</p>

<p>Our second test involved launching something soft from the cannon. One 
of my socks was the next lucky contestant, so we filled the blast chamber 
with hairspray, rammed the sock down the barrel, and fired. The cannon 
fired the sock with a MUCH louder boom, and my sock, now on fire and 
travelling in a nice arc, sailed a short distance and then landed in the 
pond at the middle of our complex with a quiet <i>plunk</i>.</p>

<p>It was finally time for the main event. I once again filled the blast 
chamber with hairspray, but this time an honest-to-goodness potato was 
rammed down into the cannon's two inch wide barrel. I pointed the cannon 
off of the second-floor balcony of our apartment and into the night.  We 
all held our breath.</p>

<p>What happened next is probably <i>still</i> being told as a story by 
the people in the next apartment complex over, since I recently found out 
that our little friend actually dented the roof of their leasing office 
upon landing.</p>

<p>The quiet <i>click</i> of the sparker was completely drowned out by 
the Earth-shattering <i>BOOOOOOOOOM</i> of the cannon.  The gases inside 
the blast chamber expanded, winning the battle with friction, and the 
potato shot into low Earth orbit.  The spud sailed high into the air, 
with a cruise speed somewhere around mach one, and landed in the 
apartment complex next to ours.  I was knocked backwards from the blast, 
my ears ringing, and slammed into our sliding glass door. The next 
morning all of our neighbors were complaining that someone in the 
neighborhood had &quot;fired a gun in the middle of the night&quot;, and 
I had a black and blue mark of my leg that was about the size of the 
bottom of a coffee cup.</p>

<p>After the cannon's "trial by fire", it went on to bigger and better 
things. One evening at a soccer game at our college, all of the players 
stopped playing and just looked up at the sky when a potato came sailing 
out of the woods with a deafing <i>BOOOOOOOOOM</i> and flew over the 
soccer field.  Another time, a pair of underwear was tested to see if it 
was &quot;tough enough to handle Earth re-entry&quot; when it was 
launched high into the air, landing in the highest limbs of a tree (where 
I imagine it is still hangs today). 
 
<p><u><font size="+2">Lessons Learned</font></u></p>

<ul>
<li>You've only got one shot... make it count</li>

<li>Wear ear plugs when firing PVC artillery... those suckers are LOUD</li>

<li>Launching your socks into orbit is fun, but it really bites when you 
have to do laundry more often because you don't have enough clothes</li>

<li>Soccer players run <i>really</i> good when they get scared</li>
</ul>
