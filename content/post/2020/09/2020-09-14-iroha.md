---

I have started practicing Japanese again using Duolingo and some other resources. Reading about [katakana][] I discovered that there are two systems of ordering it: the modern [gojūon][] and the old-fashioned [iroha][].

The interesting bit is that Iroha is a poem famous for being a perfect [pangram][] and containts each letter of the Japanese syllabary.

It is still quite present in daily life to the point that イロハ is comparable to the English expression "the ABCs".

I could extend more, but it is better to visit the Wikipedia article about it.
