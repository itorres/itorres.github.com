---

I have been in San Francisco for two weeks now and today I flight back
home. I am really looking forward to spend time with Jan, Nil and Pau.

I finally went to the [DNA Lounge][] the same night I arrived, on
January 6, and [Bootie][] was really fun. But at 10:30PM I was on my
own and quite tired after more than 24h of travel so I went back to
the apartment.

Although it was a work trip I got to walk the city on my second
weekend here. And when I say walk I mean it: East Side (5 miles) on
Saturday and West Side (10 miles) on Sunday.

I really enjoyed walking through the western shoreline of the
[Presidio][] park.

And to boot today there is a [Women's March][] against Trump in San
Francisco's Civic Center. And all around the country.
