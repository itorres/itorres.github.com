title: '2018 wk.29: docker run certbot/dns-digitalocean'
---

I'm in the middle of migrating my home services from docker on NixOS
to a private [Joyent Triton][] deployment.

While doing this my certificates expired. A few years ago I settled on
using Google's [acme client][], but it has not been updated to Letâ€™s
Encrypt v2 API. So I looked back on [certbot][] and, to my surprise,
it has two great additions:

- [Certbot Docker images][] (yes, it is *that long* since I last
  checked certbot)
- [DNS plugins][] to automate DNS management

tl;dr, this is how you use the [certbot-dns-digitalocean][] plugin
from docker to obtain a wildcard certificate.

```bash
docker run -ti --rm \
  -v /home/itorres/var/dockerdata/letsencrypt/var:/var/lib/letsencrypt \
  -v /home/itorres/var/dockerdata/letsencrypt/etc:/etc/letsencrypt \
  certbot/dns-digitalocean certonly --dns-digitalocean \
    --dns-digitalocean-credentials /etc/letsencrypt/secrets/do.ini \
	-d "itorres.net" -d "*.itorres.net"
```

I will definitely [donate to EFF][] for this.
