It's the first time in eleven years I enjoy a complete holiday:

- work holiday.
- _all_ the kids are in their summer camps.

What's a geek to do?

1. Deploy [Triton][] at home.
2. Provision a [Chef server][] and setup a bunch of recipes to
   provision VMs with services like [unbound][] or [syncthing][].
3. Decide that he is fed up with nginx and create a recipe to
   provision good old [Apache][].
4. Try out [Hugo][] and decide that the effort to migrate from Jekyll
   is worth it.
5. Just because we're at it, create some [Emacs][] convenience
   functions to create new posts.

[Triton]: https://www.joyent.com/triton/compute
[unbound]: https://unbound.net/
[Chef server]: https://docs.chef.io/install_server.html
[Apache]: https://httpd.apache.org/
[Hugo]: https://gohugo.io/
[syncthing]: https://syncthing.org/
[Emacs]: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

If you're reading this Hugo and Apache are doing their work. And the
functions are these just in case someone is interested.

```elisp
(defvar itorres-blog-path)
(defun itorres-blog-slugify (s)
  "Create a slug from a string"
  (let (dc)
    (setq dc (downcase s))
    (replace-regexp-in-string "[^[:alnum:]]" "-" dc)))

(defun itorres-blog-post-path (title)
      (format
       "%s/%s/%s/%s-%s.md"
       itorres-blog-path
       (format-time-string "%Y" nil "UTC0")
       (format-time-string "%m" nil "UTC0")
       (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" nil "UTC0")
       (itorres-blog-slugify title)))

(defun itorres-blog-front-matter (title)
  (insert "---\n")
  (insert (concat "date: '" (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%dT%TZ" nil "UTC0") "'\n"))
  (insert "lang: en\n")
  (insert "published: draft\n")
  (insert (concat "title: '" (format-time-string "%Y wk.%W: " nil "UTC0") title "'\n"))
  (insert "---\n\n"))

(defun itorres-blog-new-post (title)
  "Create new blog post with today's date and prompt for title"
  (interactive "sPost title: ")
  (let (bn)
    (setq bn (find-file (itorres-blog-post-path title)))
    (set-buffer bn)
    (itorres-blog-front-matter title)))
```

Extra ball, a handy function to copy a totp token generated from the
seed string at point.

```elisp
(defun itorres-totp ()
  "Call goathtool totp with string at point"
  (interactive)
  (let (seed token)
    (setq seed (current-word t t))
    (setq token (string-trim (shell-command-to-string (concat "~/bin/goathtool totp -b " seed))))
    (kill-new token)
    (message (concat "totp token " token " copied to kill ring"))))
```
