title: Moving to Github Pages
---

I am moving my site to [Github Pages][]. Until now I was serving it
from my virtual server at [Textdrive][], but for a static site living
on a Github repository it makes no sense.

Also, with this I can edit my site from [prose.io][], which makes it
even more convenient.

[Textdrive]: http://textdrive.com/
[prose.io]: http://prose.io
[Github Pages]: http://pages.github.com/
