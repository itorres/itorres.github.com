Well, it's funny that exactly six months ago I was talking about how [MacOS was getting into my nerves][0].


This weekend I achieved to install [Ubuntu Dapper][1] into my laptop. The reason for the switch was because after a software update MacOS didn't want to start, and I thought "if I have to tinker with an OS, I better do it with one that makes me free".

This was possible even though the CD drive doesn't work. My [issues with Apple Support][2] did end up badly, the reason being there was no track of my AppleCare contract in Apple. It's funny, for a few months before there was no issue about with a hard drive replacement. After sending the AppleCare documentation several times to Ireland I surrended and thought that buying a replacement on eBay would be cheaper in the long run. This experience didn't improve my feelings about Apple.

It's funny also that today I saw [John Gruber's article][3] about [Mark Pilgrim's switch out of MacOS][4] and how [Tim Bray is following][5] him. There's more than one geek who feels that something's rotten in Apple. The last post by [Pilgrim depicts my experience with Mail.app][6] word by word. Thanks $DEITY I am using IMAP now.

Now it's a matter of time for me to get everything I have on the iMac into DVDs, and test if it plays ball with Ubuntu too.
