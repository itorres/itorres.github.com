In the early 00s I stumbled onto The Experiment Log, a hilarious
series of four articles described by the author as:

> the various experiments that several college students (myself
> included) tried out of simple curiosity and, more often, sheer
> boredom. I hope that you find this stuff funny... but I also hope
> that you don't do it yourself. I have the feeling that we were just
> lucky that we didn't royally toast ourselves, or burn down our poor
> dorm room that we repeatedly bar-b-qued on a nightly basis, but then
> that's just my opinion. You'd be amazed what you can do with duct
> tape and a gallon of common, household bleach.

Today I wanted to share it with a friend and was unable to find it. By
sheer luck I stumbled on a mention of it with a link in
a [2003 linkroll][] after searching [DDG][] for `"The Experiment Log"
"act of god"`:

> Several college playing-with-fire "experiments" with details on how
> to recreate them. Four of the five are merely good, but number
> three, "The Act of God" is standout.
>> You might want to hold back on doing this one if you want your
>> security deposit back when you move.

The domain is dead and for sale since 2005. But thanks to [The
Internet Archive][] [Wayback Machine][] I've been able to rescue it
and do a [local backup][].

Incidentally I found out that the culprit moved his site
to [icculus.org][]. He [restored the log][]
but [got rid of it in 2013][] his `.plan` archive
is [still available][].
