If everything goes according to plan I will be in Silicon Valley from
June 14th to June 26th.

I will _definitely_ visit:

- The [DNA Lounge][] (probably on [June 16][]): The club [jwz][]
  bought and refurbished after [leaving Netscape and Mozilla][nomo].
- The [Ames Research Center][ames].

Other ideas will be well received.
