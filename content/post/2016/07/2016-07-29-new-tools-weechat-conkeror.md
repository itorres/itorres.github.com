### WeeChat

I have started using [WeeChat][]. What finally moved me to do it was
the combination of [weechat.el][] and [wee-slack][]. With them I can
chat on slack from Emacs.

Add to that the [weechat-android][] and a bit of [bitlbee][] and I have
the perfect unified messaging system which I can use from my desktop
and from my mobile sharing state between them.

So I think I will be seen on IRC again.

[bitlbee]: https://bitlbee.org

### Conkeror

[Conkeror][] is a great keyboard-oriented browser based on Firefox. I
recall having tested it years ago but since now I am used to Emacs
keystrokes browsing in conkeror feels great.
