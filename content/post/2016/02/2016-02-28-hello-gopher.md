10 Ventôse an 224 de la Révolution

Yesterday I read [a tweet by Charles Stross][tweet]:

> The MetaFilter gopher server is back after 15 years of downtime!!!
> gopher://gopher.metafilter.com

But I did remember that Gopher support had been dropped in Firefox 4.0
so I looked for a client. I knew that [sdfeu][] actively supports
Gopher so I headed there to do a quick check.

And I should not have got into that *rodent* hole for in three minutes
I had already found an [Emacs mode to browse Gopher][gopher.el].

With that solved it was simply a matter of time having
[my site served by Gopher][itorres.net:70] as well. And guess what, it
does not look so different from the HTML rendering.
