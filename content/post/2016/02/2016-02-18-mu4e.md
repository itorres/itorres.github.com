30 Pluviôse an 224 de la Révolution

One of the first things I read about Emacs was that to be proficient
in it it was good to move an important part of your daily routine into
it and email was suggested. So a year ago I tried out [Gnus][] with
not very good results.

Some time later I found out about [not much][] and I instantly loved
its website witty remarks but there was something in the client
behaviour and configuration that didn't cut it for me.

Then yesterday I found about [mu4e][], another email client that like
[not much][] was based in a [Xapian][] index of your email with some
constructs that I liked better ([contexts][]) and plenty of
[tutorials][].

So now I have *all my email* indexed in my laptop and I can search it
faster than gmail. From Emacs. How cool is that?
