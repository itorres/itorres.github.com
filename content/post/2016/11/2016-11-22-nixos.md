title: '2016 wk.47: And back to NixOS'
---

After two months using [FreeBSD][] (TrueOS) exclusively it was
apparent that I would rather live with systemd and even btrfs than
lose the benefits of using [NixOS][].

My natural preference would be [Guix][] instead but right now I'm
unable to be 100% productive with it due to lack of some packages,
services and filesystems.

[NixOS]: http://nixos.org/
[Guix]: http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/
[FreeBSD]: https://www.freebsd.org/

So I have been running NixOS again and took a chance with btrfs. And
though all my bits are still there its functionality was not
interesting over ZFS so I will come back to a ZFS NixOS setup for my
next laptop.

I will do a NixOS presentation on [December's sudoersbcn Meetup][] so
if you're curious drop by.
